                        <strong>A2:</strong><p> Your data is secure in the vehicle expense tracker built on Firebase. Firebase implements robust security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. Here are some key security features:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> Firebase encrypts data both in transit and at rest. This means that your data is protected while being transmitted over the internet and when stored in Firebase's servers.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> With Firebase's security rules, you can define granular access control policies. These rules allow you to specify who can read and write data, based on user authentication, user roles, or other custom attributes. This ensures that each user can only access the data they are authorized to see or modify.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Firebase Security Audit:</strong> Firebase undergoes regular security audits and assessments to ensure compliance with industry best practices. This helps identify and address any potential vulnerabilities, further enhancing the security of your data.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Firebase's Infrastructure Security:</strong> Firebase's infrastructure is designed to be highly secure, with measures in place to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div className="question" onClick={(e) => toggleAnswer(e.target)}>Q3: What is the maximum you can claim for car expenses?</div>
                    <div className="answer"><strong>A3: </strong><p>

You will be able to use the 2023/2024 per km rate to claim up to 5000 business kilometres you`ve driven throughout the 2023/2024 tax year as a tax deduction.

Note that you won`t be able to claim other vehicle expenses, as the rate is meant to cover all running costs of your vehicle, including depreciation. A higher per km rate for the new tax year will mean you can get a higher deduction at tax time for the kilometres you travel for work.</p></div>

                        <strong>A6:</strong><p> You can use either of 2 methods to calculate deductions for car expenses:</p>

                        <p>If you are claiming car expenses for more than one car, you can use a different method for each car. You can also change the method you use in different income years for the same car.</p>
